GRAM is inspired by ChebyKAN by Synodic Month https://github.com/SynodicMonth/ChebyKAN where classical Chebyshev polynomials are used inplace of Bsplines. This repository will be using Grams Polynomial with an added basis layer with SiLU.

**DISCLAIMER**
Currently running tests so GRAM will be subjected to change.
