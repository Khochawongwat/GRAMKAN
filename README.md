Shifted Discrete Chebyshev Net is inspired by ChebyKAN by Synodic Month https://github.com/SynodicMonth/ChebyKAN where classical Chebyshev polynomials are used inplace of Bsplines. This repository will use Shifted Discrete Chebychev Polynomials (SDCP) over the MNIST dataset.

This study is to do establish a benchmark over traditional KAN, ChebyKAN, and our SDCPKAN. Comparisons between the convergence, and number of parameters, accuracy of each model will be made.
